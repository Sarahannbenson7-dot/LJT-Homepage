I am a first-year Ph.D. candidate at the [HKUST NLP Group](https://nlp.ust.hk/), Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), supervised by [Professor Junxian He](https://junxianhe.com/).

I received my B.Eng. degree from [Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU)](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/) in June 2024, where I was awarded the Zhiyuan Honor Scholarship.

My research focuses on **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning**. Specifically, I am interested in:
*   LLM Reasoning and Reinforcement Learning
*   Hallucination in Vision-Language Models (VLM)
*   LLM Truthfulness and Interpretability
